\chapter*{Foreword}

These notes contain the topics that were discussed during the reading group
\begin{center}
    \textit{Intersection Theory on Moduli Spaces}
\end{center}
which met in Pisa during the second semester of the 2024/25 accademic year.
The reading group was organized by Leonardini Pietro and Tarini Bernardo. 

Each chapter corresponds to a lecture. The name of the speaker is shown at the start of the appropriate chapter.


Some information was added while typing the notes to make the delivery clearer, but these notes have no aspiration to be thorough. For further reading you may refer to the bibliography. Each chapter also mentions which sources are more relevant.

The goal of the reading group was to lay out the basic theory of algebraic stacks and intersection theory in order to combine the two in the context of moduli theory.

In the first two chapters we lay out the basic categorical notions involved and we define stacks, which are then upgraded to algebraic stacks in the third chapter with the motivation of moduli theory.

The fourth, fith and sixth chapters give a brief overview of intersection theory over schemes, focussing on the definition of the Chow rings with related functoriality issues and the basics of the theory of Chern classes of vector bundles.
